# Heap and Heap Sort (COMP8090SEF Task 2)

This repository contains a simple implementation of a **min-heap** data structure and the **heap sort** algorithm in Python, for the Task 2 self-study project of COMP8090SEF.

## 1. Files

- `heap.py`: definition of the `MinHeap` class (array-based min-heap).
- `heapsort.py`: implementation of the `heap_sort` function using `MinHeap`.
- `examples.py`: simple command-line examples and test cases.

## 2. How to run

### 2.1 Requirements

- Python 3.10 or above (standard library only, no third-party packages).

### 2.2 Running the demos

From the project directory:

```bash
python examples.py
